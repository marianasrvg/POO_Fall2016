# Final project Oriented Object Programming 
The first aproach to developed an arcade video game as final project for the Oriented Object Programming class in JAVA.
## The game!
This VINTAGE video game, because yes we were dealing with PIXELS! Was for two persons to compite to see who could possible move their character away from the obstacles for more time.
We decide to do a super handmaded game since we love dealing with memory, pixels and positions (lying, but we wanted it to be vintage though). Of course this was the first approach and a total failure we got fun for a while. See KEEP THE MOVE and KEEP THE MOVE 2.0 for the final results

## The developers!
Martín Linares and Mariana Sierra, lovers of dying with difficult projects :D

## More details!
The actual name of the class - Progamación Orientada a Objetos
School - Western Institute of Higher Education and Technology; aka ITESO.
